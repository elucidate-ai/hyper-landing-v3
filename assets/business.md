What We Do
Hyper is South Africa's only dedicated data engineering platform. We design, build, and operate data warehousing and analytics infrastructure for organisations that need reliable, well-structured data but don't have the engineering capability to deliver it in-house.
We focus exclusively on building robust, production-grade data infrastructure [JB1.1]that our clients can rely on every day. We solve one problem end-to-end: getting raw, messy data into a clean, governed, queryable state and delivering actionable insight [JB2.1]on top of it.
Every engagement starts with a structured discovery phase. We diagnose [JB3.1]the client’s data landscape and define a clear scope of work. From there, we onboard clients onto our managed delivery platform: a standardised infrastructure layer covering orchestration, warehousing, monitoring, and reporting, configured to each client’s requirements.
For clients, this means faster time to value, full visibility into project [JB4.1][JB4.2]health and system status from day one, and a seamless transition from initial build to ongoing managed service. Their data infrastructure is always [JB5.1]monitored, maintained, and evolving with their needs.
The Problem We Solve
Mid-market companies (typically 50 to 500 employees) accumulate huge amounts of valuable data across their systems, but struggle to bring it together in a way that drives decisions.
When they try to solve this, none of the common options work well. Hiring a data analyst or data scientist doesn’t help, because these roles aren’t designed to build the [JB6.1]foundational infrastructure. Hiring a single data engineer rarely works either, because the role demands a rare combination of infrastructure expertise, data modelling skill, and deep business context — too many disciplines for one hire to cover reliably.
Then there are generalist consultancies. Because these firms spread themselves across many disciplines, [JB7.1]the quality of their data engineering work is often poor. The scope bloats into machine learning, BI tooling, and strategy work that wasn’t needed. In every case, the core problem (reliable data engineering) goes unsolved, and budget is wasted.[JL8.1]
Value Proposition
We are the alternative that eliminates these failure modes. As a dedicated data engineering platform backed by an experienced team, we bring deep specialist expertise without the overhead of permanent hires, and a level of focus that generalist firms cannot match.
Every engagement begins with a structured discovery phase — a deep dive into the business context and technical landscape. This produces a set of valuable artefacts, including data architecture assessments, source inventories, and prioritised roadmaps, that give clients a clear understanding of their data estate and a practical path forward — regardless of what they decide to do next.
Even if a client were to hire their own data engineers, they would struggle to match the quality of what we deliver. Our platform standardises delivery so clients get repeatable quality, transparent progress, and a clear path from initial engagement to ongoing managed service. Every part of our operation (our tooling, our process, our expertise) is optimised for this single discipline. That depth of specialisation is something a small in-house team simply cannot replicate.
Most data engineering engagements end at delivery. Ours don't. Clients transition seamlessly into an ongoing managed service — infrastructure is monitored, maintained, and evolved as the business grows. New sources are integrated, models are refined, and issues are caught proactively. Our team operates as a permanent specialist extension of the client's organisation, so their data infrastructure compounds in value over time without ever needing to build the capability in-house.
Target Audience
Our primary clients are mid-market businesses that have outgrown spreadsheets and manual reporting but are not large enough to justify a dedicated internal data engineering team. They typically have data spread across multiple operational [JB9.1]systems with no unified warehouse[JB10.1], and have either failed at a previous attempt to solve this or are unsure where to start.
They may sit in any industry, but share a common profile: data-rich, engineering-poor, and underserved by the current market of generalist consultancies and misaligned hires.
